I've used created_at and updated_at as the change data dates because those are the dates the RDS is using
	based on the mapping document. 
	

diagnosis: 
	value_coded.  we have two possible value coded values per record, do we take the one with primary or secondary diagnosis?
	
medication_adherences: the mapping is confusing.  I can't find anything like medication_prescriptions or 
	medication_prescription_id in rds, and I don't know how to use {drug_dispensed_id}
	difficult to tell what the unique key for change data is supposed to be with outcomes
person_addresses:
	need lookup logic for functions categorize_address, get_district_id
	rds.person_address.landmark is missing
	rds.person_address.date_changed is missing
person_has_types
	I can't see the difference between person_type_id = 4 and person_type_id = 2
	how person_id maps needs to be more clear and testd.
	person_has_types has a fk to the person table, but the id's used in person_has_types overlap
	since they come from different tables. For example user_id and person_id.  Should person_has_types only load records in the person table?
	That's what I've done.
